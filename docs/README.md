## How To Use These Docs

- Use `project-charter.md` as the source of truth for scope.
- Use `product-spec.md` for implementation details and acceptance criteria.
- Use `roadmap-90-days.md` during weekly planning and sprint breakdown.
- Use `checklists.md` before launch and before each milestone review.
- Record any significant product/strategy changes in `decision-log.md`.

## Working Agreement

- Keep scope tight: directory + booking funnel first.
- Prefer shipping and learning over perfect initial architecture.
- Every roadmap item must have an owner and measurable outcome.
