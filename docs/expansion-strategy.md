# Future Expansion Strategy

## Expansion Rule

Do not expand to new verticals until yoga shows repeatable acquisition + retention economics.

## Priority Verticals (Post-Yoga)

1. Driving schools (high TAM, low software maturity)
2. Physiotherapy and massage
3. Martial arts / pilates / climbing / personal training / swimming
4. Language, music, photography, cooking, ceramics schools
5. Seasonal/event operators (kayak, boat, ski instructors)
6. Municipal sports centers (OSiR; longer sales cycle, higher stickiness)

## Readiness Gates

- Stable onboarding playbook
- Measurable trial-to-paid conversion
- Proven widget-led acquisition motion
- Repeatable support and operations bandwidth

## Reusable Platform Assets

- Booking + calendar + reminders
- QR check-in flow
- Listing + claim funnel
- Embeddable widget distribution
